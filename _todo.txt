TODO:
* Find good way to represent game objects and operations (first transformations) that can be performed on them.
* Add repo to github.



Thoughts about structure:

    Game objects
        Mesh data
        transform data
        impulse data
        parent/children relationships
    Objects are a collection of data. These data types appear only once.
    They could be represented as structs of pointers to structs of data.
    If an object doesn't have the data, the pointer is a null pointer.
    Game objects don't define operations that happen on them but only state.
